# Airport-Satisfaction-analysis-project

This repository contains a report on the analysis of airline passenger satisfaction. The report aims to identify the key factors that contribute to passenger satisfaction and predict customer satisfaction based on various inputs using machine learning algorithms.

## Report Description
The report provides an overview of the analysis conducted on a dataset obtained from Kaggle, which contains passenger survey information. The dataset consists of 24 columns and 129,880 rows, including attributes such as gender, customer type, age, type of travel, class, distance, and ratings for different services.

The report outlines the methodology followed, including data cleaning procedures to handle null values and convert categorical attributes into numerical values. It also includes statistical inference and data visualizations to gain insights into the dataset, such as density plots, boxplots, mosaic plots, and correlation heatmaps.

Furthermore, the report explores the implementation of machine learning models for predicting customer satisfaction. Logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and support vector machine (SVM) classification models are discussed and their performance evaluated.
Methodology
The analysis involves several steps:

## Data Cleaning: 
The dataset is cleaned to remove any null values and convert categorical variables to numerical values for easy analysis.

S## tatistical Inference and Data Visualization: Density plots, boxplots, and mosaic plots are used to visualize the relationship between continuous and categorical variables with passenger satisfaction. Insights are drawn from the visualizations, such as the correlation between variables.

## Machine Learning Models: 
Classification models, including Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), are trained and evaluated. Accuracy measures are used to assess the performance of the models.

## Insights
The analysis reveals several insights into airline passenger satisfaction:

Older passengers tend to be more satisfied than younger ones.
Female passengers generally show higher satisfaction levels compared to males.
Loyal customers and those traveling for business purposes are more likely to be satisfied.
Inflight entertainment and ease of online booking are highly correlated with passenger satisfaction.
Based on the accuracy of the models, LDA performs the best among the tested algorithms, while Logistic Regression shows the least accuracy.

These insights provide valuable information for airline companies to understand the key factors that contribute to passenger satisfaction and make informed decisions to improve their services.
